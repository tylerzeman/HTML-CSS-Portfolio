        <p class="boxtype1">Hello everyone, my name is Tyler Zeman. I am 23 years old and aspire becoming a Full Stack
            Developer. Before I have taken a 1-month web development Bootcamp with Nucamp in Decemeber
            2020. I hope to gain lots of valuable information from the Full Stack Bootcamp I am attending this summer
            through the University of Minnesota.

        <p class="boxtype2">For my 1st Bootcamp project we designed a webpage appication that allows the user to store website links to local storage. So if you have a favorite site you like to visit such as a social
            media site, streaming site, as lonk as the link is reachable it can be stored here. As another feature of the app we added a Weather API that allows the user to check the weather for today is going to be.
            Another member in my group was an artist and created a garfield gif that we decided to add for our motivational quote API for the bottom of the app. There is also a few themes to choose from in the 
            dropdown menu such as dark mode, and space mode to include the amazing James Webb telescope images that were released.

        <p class="boxtype1">My 2nd Bootcamp porject titled FitSpace, was designed to be a fitness app that allows the user to register/login with our backend SQL DB. The user is then able to search for a workout
            that can be searched for by equipment, body part, or even muscle group. Once the user decides on what to search the Dashboard will then be populated with various workouts with gifs on how to perform
            said workout with a title and various properties including a save feature. This save feature will allow the user to save the workout to their account in the database and be able to view them whenever
            they log back into FitSpace.
