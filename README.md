## Project Description

This week we were tasked with creating a portfolio using HTML, and CSS. Starting from scratch, creating my own code this is my starter template that I will
continue to work on throughout the summer to eventually add more programming languages. I presented my name, an image of myself, and links to my projects that directs to where they are placed on the page. Images have links that take you to the deployed application/website. I used GHpages to deploy my portfolio link can be found below.
